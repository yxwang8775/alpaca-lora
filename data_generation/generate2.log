Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Alice and Bob are playing a game. Bob is trying to guess Alice's number in as few guesses as possible. Alice will tell Bob whether his answer is too high or too low. Bob writes his answer as numeric digits (such as '50' or '49').So Bob needs to consider the possible range of the number from the conversation history and then guess to narrow his search. Don't guess the same number twice! Write the answer of Bob.

### Input:
Alice: I'm thinking of a number between 0 and 100 (inclusive). You have to guess it. Just give me a number.
